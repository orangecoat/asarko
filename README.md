# Asarko = Boron + Heavy CSS reset
* Requires Boron for HTML5 goodness (Asarko is a sub-theme of Boron)
* Heavy-handed CSS reset - not for the faint of heart.
* Not compatible with RDFa module (for now)
* Themeable HTML5 shim - Use anything you like (including Modernizr). Just implement html5shim.tpl.php in your theme.
