# Asarko = Boron + Heavy CSS reset
* Requires [Boron](http://drupal.org/project/boron) for HTML5 goodness (Asarko
  is a sub-theme of Boron). Also recommended: [HTML5
  Tools](http://drupal.org/project/html5_tools)
* Heavy-handed CSS reset - not for the faint of heart. If you're building an
  admin theme, you may definitely not want to use this.
* Themeable HTML5 shim - Use anything you like (including Modernizr). Just
  implement html5shim.tpl.php in your theme.
